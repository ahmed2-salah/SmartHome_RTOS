# Smart Home Project based on RTOS ðŸ§©
## Architecture of the system
![Arcitecture](https://github.com/ahmed2-salah/SmartHome_RTOS/assets/90197922/ab6f799d-9f00-48cf-8f74-a96e517e181e)

## Systems Tasks
1. SwitchHandle ()
2. LED Control  ()
3. doorSensorRead ()
4. Buzzer Control ()
5. LCD display ()
6. Temperature Read()
7. UART communication ()

## System Shared resources
1. LED_sw_State
2. door_sw_State
3. Temp_value

## System design
* Creating Binary SemaphoreA to sychronize between  LED Control  () and SwitchHandle ().
* Creating Binary SemaphoreB to sychronize between  doorSensorRead () and Buzzer Control ().
* Creating counting Semaphore to protect LCD (Hardware shared resource) with intial cout = 3
